# generator-fumunda [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/toadkicker/generator-fumunda.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toadkicker/generator-fumunda)

Welcome to the Fumunda generator. Generate your Angular JS app fumunda a WADL.

This is currently under development. Don't expect anything to work. Pull requests are welcome.

## Getting Started

It is great for rapid application development. It is not great for user experience or venture capitalists.

If you want to:

* Use MongoDB, AngularJS, and Twitter Bootstrap as part of your UI stack
* focus on building an API and not worry about the finer details of UI development
* Want to a rich web client to CRUD your data
* Want to quickly generate an admin tool from a WADL

...then build your app with fumunda.

### Fumunda


To install generator-fumunda from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-fumunda
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo fumunda --app myAppName --url http://localhost:8080/application.wadl
```
